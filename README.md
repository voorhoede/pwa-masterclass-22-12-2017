# Masterclass Progressive Web Apps

## Project setup

This project serves a chat app which we will enhance into a full fledged Progressive Web App.

## Quick start

This project requires [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://npmjs.org/).

After installing dependencies using `npm install` the following scripts are available on all exercise branches:

`npm run ...` | Description
---|---
`build` | Revisions and writes static files from `src/` to `cache/`.
`start` | Starts an [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/) server on `http://localhost:7924` (7924 is "PWAS" in T9).
`watch` | Watches changes and recompiles CSS and JS.

More (sub) tasks are available in [package.json > scripts](package.json).
